          <b>What&apos;s with the surnames?</b> <br />I have 3 nationalities,
          Bulgarian, Turkish and British, I was born in Bulgaria moved to Turkey
          at 11, moved to UK at 24.
          <br /> Dora is my Turkish surname, due to some political structures in
          Turkey i had to chose a Turkish surname. I was born in Bulgaria as
          Semra Refkaeva Shukrieva, but semrashukrieva.com was taken so I took
          semradora.com
