          <b>What&apos;s with the surnames?</b> <br />I have 3 nationalities,
          Bulgarian, Turkish and British, I was born in Bulgaria moved to Turkey
          at 11, moved to UK at 24.
          <br /> Dora is my Turkish surname, due to some political structures in
          Turkey i had to chose a Turkish surname. I was born in Bulgaria as
          Semra Refkaeva Shukrieva, but semrashukrieva.com was taken so I took
          semradora.com

        <h3>My story ( I will make this shorter in time) </h3>
        <p>
          I learned React and Javascript and Typscript in a bootcamp ( If you
          are thinking, well she is just a bootcamp grad &quot;not good,
          booooo&quot; I suggest you close this page now, we are not on the same
          page) I was honered a scholarship from Earnest&Young to do the
          bootcamp (Â£6K), I was ambitious enough to impress them.
